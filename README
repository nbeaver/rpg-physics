# RPG Physics Problems #

These are physics problems inspired by role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons.

I actually started working on them when tutoring algebra students in high school.

The difficult level varies between middle school and college level,
with some introductory Newtonian physics
(including optimization and full-blown two-dimensional kinematics)
toward the end.

Those who are familiar with Dr. James Kakalios'
["The Physics of Superheroes"](http://www.physicsofsuperheroes.com/)
might see some similarities,
although I didn't read that delightful book until after I'd written most of these.
